# DEPRECATION NOTICE

This project is in **deprecated**, and the Avalanche Explorer is in the process of being migrated to this [React App](https://github.com/ava-labs/explorer-v2) instead. As such, some URLs will redirect to the new explorer experience as it is developed, starting with the Home page and C-Chain page.

# Avalanche Explorer

Frontend Vue.js application for displaying Avalanche network activity and blockchains data from the [Ortelius indexer](https://github.com/ava-labs/ortelius) and [Avalanche-Go client](https://github.com/ava-labs/gecko).

## Prerequisites

-   Node v14

## Installation

1. `yarn install`

## Development

1. `yarn serve` - project runs with hot reloading

When you go to the app on your browser, you might get a warning saying "Site is not secure." This is because we are signing our own SSL Certificates. Please ignore and continue to the website.

The homepage currently redirects to the subnet explorer so to view the app you'll need to go to a specific blockchain url such as: `https://localhost:8081/blockchain/11111111111111111111111111111111LpoYY`

## Configuration

See `.env`. By default, the Avalanche Explorer interfaces with the Everest test network.

For local development against ortelius and avalanche go, use the docker container setup by the ortelius team. Info can be
found [here](https://github.com/ava-labs/ortelius#quick-start-with-standalone-mode). You can also connect to a local network you setup yourself, install and run
instances by following the instructions found in each lib:

-   Data indexing backend [Ortelius](https://github.com/ava-labs/ortelius).
-   Avalanche clients via [Avalanche-Go](https://github.com/ava-labs/gecko) or [Avash](https://github.com/ava-labs/avash).

Once those are stood up and running, run `yarn serve:local` the application will use the configs in the `.env.hosted` file as the base urls for ortelius and avalanche go

## Services

When creating http requests, do so from a service abstraction layer. refer to src/service/\* for an example. The http layer, models and helpers should all be centralized into this layer.

## Known Addresses

The file `/src/known_addresses.ts` is a dictionary that maps an address to a name. This can be customized freely.
